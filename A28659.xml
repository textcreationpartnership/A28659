         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For how could I further that worke more effectually with God, then by a ſacrifice of thankeſgiving? or with men, then by the Doctrine of Activity? and theſe two, are the generall Contents of both my following Diſcourſes. In the firſt of them, I doe but write an Hiſtory (Epitomie rather) of the Lords mercy, our Soveraignes goodnes, and the proſperous paines of this happy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In the latter, (which was firſt preached) I doe preſſe mine auditory to bring Bellowes, and Fuell, to the
<note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 3.2.</note> refiners fire, and to ſtand cloſe to the particulars of our bleſſed Vow and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.

Of that <hi>Captivitie,</hi> and their <hi>Deliverance,</hi> ſee more fully in the book of <hi>Chronicles. The Lord ſtirred up the spirit of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>King of</hi> Perſia,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>that he made a Proclamation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Kingdome, and put it alſo in writing, ſaying, Thus ſaith</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>The Lord God of Heaven hath charged me to build him an houſe in Jeruſalem, which is in</hi> Iudah: <hi>Who is there among you of all his people?</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62468:6"/>we may ſee our ſtate hitherto expreſſed in the Iewiſh as in a glaſſe, and ſo may whet our attentions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the very threſhold of the Diſcourſe with this ſhort <hi>Paralel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Were they Gods owne ſelected people? ſo are we thus farre, being the only Monarchy and Kingdoms of pure Proteſtants, now ſtanding upon the face of the Earth: for all other people are either no Chriſtians, no pure Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, or no Kingdome and Monarchy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Was their oppreſſour litterall <hi>Babylon?</hi> whence came our late Apoſtaſyes and diſtractions, but from <hi>Babylon</hi> the myſticall?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The only means that they had left were <hi>(praeces &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae)</hi> prayers and teares,
<note place="margin">Ezr. c. 1 &amp;c 2. Dan. c. 9. Pſ. 137.1, 2.</note> beſides a few poore deſpiſed, (but yet active) <hi>Prieſts, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Levites.</hi> And were not our harps and hopes too, hung up upon the willows but a while ago.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The manner of their <hi>Deliverance,</hi> it was by <hi>Retortion,</hi> for the <hi>Iews</hi> were freed, and <hi>Babylon</hi> her ſelf became a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and is it not ſo with us (according to the ſaying of the <hi>Wiſe man) That the righteous is delivered out of trouble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>and the wicked cometh in his ſtead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Finally, the end of their freedom was to <hi>build a Temple to their God;</hi> and is it not the hope and prayer of all Saints amongſt us, that our <hi>Deliverance</hi> may end in a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church?
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 1.36.</note> Amen: <hi>the Lord God of my Lord the King ſay ſo too.</hi> Thus the very Occaſion of this <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and our <hi>Thankeſgiving</hi> are Paralells. So much for a whet upon the threſhold.</p>

            <p>This ſhort ſweet Song doth conſiſt of three parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62468:6"/>3. An <hi>Incouragement</hi> againſt thoſe difficulties which they had, did, and might yet farther meet withall. For their firſt returne was not compleate, all the <hi>Iewes</hi> came not home with <hi>Ezra,</hi> but ſome wanted <hi>will,</hi> and others <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to return. This incouragement is expreſſed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, ver. 5, 6. <hi>They that ſow in teares ſhall reape in joy. He that goeth forth, &amp;c.</hi> that is, ye know the difficulties and hardſhips that the Husbandman doth meet withall in his calling, his ſeed-time ordinarily is in the Winter-ſeaſon, and therefore he may then meet with many a bluſtering ſtorme and pinching froſt, and ſo doth ſow in teares; but here is his comfort, that the time of Harveſt is a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine ſeaſon, and then he is like to reape a full crop in faire weather with joy. So though the begining of our return and of this <hi>Deliverance,</hi> may, and doth meet with many oppoſites and oppoſitions, with a <hi>Sanballat,</hi> a <hi>Tobiah,</hi>

            <p>The Text then hath in it the force; firſt of an <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to reall and verball thankfulneſſe, which may not only fill the heart, but flow out at the mouth, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And beſides that, here is ſecondly a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the greatneſſe of that (though but partiall) <hi>Deliverance,</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>to be the turning of a Captivity of Zion, even to the very aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the captives themſelves.</hi> The ſubſtance of both theſe branches (namely of this <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>) and ſo conſequently of the whole Text, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into this ſhort ſentence.</p>

<note place="margin">Eſt. 6.</note> Surely on <hi>Hamans</hi> part it is two-fold. Firſt, <hi>Haman</hi> is commanded by the ſame King publikely to honour <hi>Mordecai</hi> in perſon.
<note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Then the King ſaid to</hi> Haman, <hi>make haſte and take the apparell, and the horſe as thou haſt ſaid, and doe even ſo to</hi> Mordecai <hi>the Jew that ſitteth at the Kings gate, let nothing faile of all that thou haſt spoken. Then tooke Haman the apparell and the horſe, and arraied</hi> Mordecai, <hi>and brought him on horſback through the ſtreet of the City, and proclaimed before him,</hi> Thus ſhall it be done unto the man whom the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to honour.
<note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> Let us but imagine with our ſelves how ſcurvily did <hi>Haman</hi> looke, when like a page he did lacky along before <hi>Mordecai's</hi> horſe, yea and how faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unmuſically did he ſigh out that Proclamation, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done unto the man,</hi> &amp;c.

<note place="margin">Eſt. 7.10.

<note place="margin">Pro. 11.8.</note> 
                  <hi>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his ſtead.</hi> But to returne from this digreſſion to my <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliverances</hi> again, and to expoſtulate the matter with them more fully, I muſt tell them yet farther that they are guilty of a double tranſgreſſion; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, they are ingratefull both to the Lord, and to his choyce inſtruments, they doe trample unparalel'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall mercies under foot, and ſo are unworthy to breath in theſe bleſſed times which we ſee. Is this your thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe to the Lord, the King, and the ſupreame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Kingdome, all which doe deſerve your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſelves, for their protection, wiſdome and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe over us? or what els thinke you, are not King and Parliament ſo wiſe, ſo Orthodox, ſo well affected to the publike good, as your ſelves? Shall the Lord ſhew his ſpeciall providence in an aſtoniſhing Deliverance, ſhall the greateſt in the Land acknowledge it, and ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62468:10"/>publike command be given to proclaime it, and yet will (nay durſt) ye ſtill to bite the lip, to ſhake the head or to grumble ſecretly at ſuch proceedings? Brethren (I ſpeak to all true Proteſtants and cordiall Subjects) I charge you by your thankfullneſſe, and by all the mercies lately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ye obſerve, marke out and purſue (lawfully) to the uttermoſt, all ſuch murmurers and repiners at the preſent bleſſings of Deliverance and Reformation. They are Ingratefull in a high meaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, they are no friends to our greateſt good neither: for who are they which doe now ſuffer, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents and Delinquencies? Who are they which do purſue, but the juſtice of God and man? Again, what is it that is now laboured for, by thoſe great Steerſ-men above, but to ſtabliſh and defend true Religion, Soveraignty, Laws, Parliaments and Liberties? And yet we have men, who either expreſly, or about the buſh, dare tell the people of a kind of perſecution, afflictions, hard times now, and I know not what. And indeed it is common with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayers and fellons to account the publike Aſſizes, a time of afflictions. Yea with all Delinquents the execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is nick-named a perſecution: and is it imaginable then that this Tribe can give hearty thanks for the preſent worke of Deliverance? Note them out therfore for men of corrupt minds, back-friends, yea back-biaſes to the weal-publike, and ſuch to whom our gladneſſe is but their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Rumpatur, quiſquis, rumpitur invidia.</hi> In a word, do but marke (my Brethren) what perſons (Lay or Clergy) are moſt dull and backward to the means and pieces of this Reformation, as firſt, <hi>To dayes of publike humiliation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,</hi> Next, to the late <hi>

                  <hi>Or hath God aſſaied to goe and take him a Nation from the midſt of another Nation</hi> (a Nation of Proteſtants out of a Nation of Papiſts) <hi>by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by ſignes and by wonders, and by warre, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out arme, and by great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in</hi> Aegypt <hi>before your eyes?</hi> As all thoſe ſeven particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of mercy (<hi>viz.</hi> temptations, ſignes, wonders, warr, mighty-hand, ſtretched-out-arme, great terrours) were made up in <hi>Iſraels Aegyptian</hi> freedome, ſo could we pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell them amongſt us, but the taske would take up too much time.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſhort, were they brought into a fruitful Land, where they had the Oracles and Ordinances of God above all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62468:11"/>Let me ſpeake freely, I conceive that we have more in both theſe particulars then they, for</p>
               <p>Firſt, our Land in my judgement (with ſubmiſſion) hath bin more fruitfull conſtantly then was theirs; for how many famines reade we to have bin in <hi>Cannaan</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively?
<note place="margin">Gen: 12.10. Gen. 26.1. Gen. 42.5. Ruth 1.1. &amp;c.</note> As in the times of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>Ruth.</hi> I thinke you can hardly paralell that number in the like time and kinde in this Iſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> (true they had miracles, and we have wonders, but otherwiſe) they did ſee Chriſt a farre off, through a cloud of painefull and coſtly Ceremonies: but we behold him come, and, as it were, face to face in his Evangelicall Ordinances. And let me adde, no age or Nation, paſt or preſent, under Heaven, did or doth enjoy ſuch a cleere, quick, powerfull, practicall Miniſtry, as is now in this Iſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and hath bin amongſt us for ſome late yeers.

I may ſay ſeriouſly of them all, that they are more then I am able to expreſſe, ſome of them I have reſolved now to touch upon, ſuch as are neweſt for time, and doe come neereſt the Text for Nature; and in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62468:11"/>reckoning up of theſe, I ſhall have ſome eye to the Copy in my Text. Here we ſee an exact enumeration (or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring) of all the ingredients of this admirable Deliverance of the Jewiſh nation. As 1. The Author, <hi>God, When the Lord.</hi> 2. Their Miſery, <hi>a Captivity.</hi> 3. The Manner of the Mercy, <hi>turning, or returning.</hi> 4. The Delivered, <hi>Zion.</hi> And 5. finally, <hi>The extent</hi> of this goodneſſe, it was <hi>aſtoniſhing,</hi> and made them like men in a dreame. How accutately could we match and Paralell every one of thoſe particulars with anſwerable branches in our preſent <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Deliverance?</hi> but becauſe that whole compariſon would be too large; let us cull out one or two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and compare them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Authour of turning their Captivity was God, <hi>When the Lord turned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And indeed he alone it is <hi>that maketh warres to ceaſe unto the end of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 46. v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>he breaketh the bow and cutteth the speare in ſunder, he burneth the Chariot in the fire.</hi> This God alone it was that did turn back our late ſtreames of bloud, who but he (to ſpeake properly) had a hand in the beginning of that turning? For 1. Some amongſt us could not. 2. Others would not ſtop thoſe evils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The godly and loyall-hearted inferiour ſubjects, they could only mourne in ſecret, and ſometimes openly, when leave was granted, but what elſe had they power to doe in the depth of theſe commotions?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 11. v, 3.</note> If the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations be deſtroyed, what can the righteous doe? Our generall publique foundations are two. <hi>Religion; Lawes,</hi> and both theſe (ſaith the Preamble to the Proteſtation) Papiſts and others, did endeavour to undermine and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert. Nay further, it was with us too well, like as with <hi>Judah</hi> in the time of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Saith he,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 59. v 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Judgement is turned away backward, and juſtice standeth afarre off, truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from evill maketh himſelfe a prey (or was accompted mad.)</hi> Therefore ſome could not ſtop the danger.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62468:12"/>2. And others would not quench the fier (ſuppoſing that they could have done it) but were <hi>ſubtill Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries</hi> (as that Preamble calls them) <hi>brands and billowes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King 12. v. 10, 11.</note> like <hi>Rehoboams</hi> young Counſellers, which were all for preſſures and ſeverity. Or elſe as thoſe falſe Prophets to King <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 22. v. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe up, goe up and proſper,</hi> was their cry. But bleſſed be that God which hath the hearts of Kings in his hand, and did guide the heart of our <hi>Soveraigne</hi> to hearken to that wiſer Counſell of his better <hi>Senators.</hi> Thus ſome could not, others would not ſtanch the bloud; 'tis the Lord alone hath done it originally. If any one preſent be not throughly convinced of this, that this was the Lords ſpeciall worke, let him call to mind thoſe Marks of Gods finger in a <hi>Deliverance,</hi> which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, and apply them. They were theſe in ſhort.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">1 Sam 23. v. 26</note> When <hi>Deliverance</hi> commeth <hi>Suddenly</hi> in time of <hi>Extremity,</hi> this is a ſigne of a divine finger. So was it with <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 27.</note> when <hi>Saul</hi> and his men compaſſed <hi>David</hi> and his men round about in the hill of <hi>Hachilah. But there came a meſſenger unto Saul, ſaying, Haſte thee and come: for the Philiſtines have invaded the land.</hi> A ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it was, that now when <hi>Saul</hi> had <hi>David</hi> (as it were) in a bagg, the Lord did ſend <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who were alſo <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, to pluck back <hi>Saul</hi> by the ſterne as it were, and ſo to give freedome to the man after Gods own heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When things are brought about by <hi>Contrariety. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth light in the darkneſſe,</hi> that is the wonder <hi>[in the darkneſſe]</hi> for dawning to ariſe out of darkneſſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 112. v. 4.</note> and then light out of that dawning it is naturall. For <hi>Spring</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Summer</hi> to come after <hi>Spring,</hi> it is alſo naturall: But when <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone</hi> ſhall ſpring out of <hi>deepe midnight,</hi> and <hi>Mid-ſommer</hi> out of <hi>Mid-winter,</hi> this muſt needs be done by a divine power: for <hi>Natura nihil agit per ſaltum,</hi> Nature in all her workes doth proceed by degrees. In a word, <hi>when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62468:12"/>the wicked are taken in their owne pit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 7.15, 16.</note> (that is) in a pit of their owne digging, ſo that themſelves doe not or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid their owne workes; I tell you, this is the Lords doing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When there is a <hi>Concurrence</hi> of many <hi>caſualties,</hi> and <hi>accidents</hi> together, Gods ſpeciall providence is cheefely ſeene in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When there is a great working upon mans ſpirits,
<note place="margin">Ezra 1. v. 1.</note> as it is ſaid of this <hi>Jewiſh Deliverance,</hi> that God ſtirred up the ſpirit of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When there is a ſmooth harmony of helpfull <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> as in <hi>Hamans</hi> fall and defeat, as 1.
<note place="margin">Eſth. 6 v 1.</note> That the King <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> ſhould be ſleepeleſſe that night. 2. Next, that among many other meanes of paſſing the time, he ſhould make choyce of hearing the <hi>Chronicles</hi> read unto him. 3. That in reading,
<note place="margin">ver. 2. ver 3.</note> they ſhould fall upon that ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Merdecaies</hi> good ſervice. 4. That the Kings thoughts ſhould pitch upon ſuch a reward for him, to breake <hi>Hamans</hi> hopes and heart. 5.
<note place="margin">ver. 6, 7.</note> That <hi>Haman</hi> ſhould then come in, when the King was contriving how to honour <hi>Mordecai.</hi> 6. Yea,
<note place="margin">ver. 4.</note> that he ſhould be comming in with ſuch an errand, to beg the hanging of the ſame <hi>Mordecai.</hi> This conſort of <hi>Circumſtances</hi> doth declare cleerely a ſpeciall providence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A proportion of Puniſhment upon the enemies of the truth. As that <hi>Haman</hi> which would have hanged <hi>Mordecai,</hi> ſhould be payd in his owne coyne,
<note place="margin">Eſth 7. v. 10. Act. 23.2, 3.</note> and upon his owne gallowes. <hi>That Ananias the ſmiter, ſhould alſo be ſmitten.</hi> All theſe prints of a ſpeciall providence are very legible in our preſent <hi>Deliverance.</hi> Therefore let us all conclude concerning this firſt branch <hi>[the Authour]</hi> with the words of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>This is the Lords doing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 118. v. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>it is marvelous in our eyes.</hi> So much touching the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Miſery. <hi>Captivity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is that he hath done? <hi>Anſw.</hi> He hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Captivity.</p>

               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, who is ignorant that the free prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of pure <hi>Doctrines,</hi> the free exerciſe of <hi>powerfull practice,</hi> have beene by ſome (they were neither few nor meane ones) hated, perſecuted, ſuppreſſed, Lectures deſtroyed, Sabbaths trampled, Worſhip innovated; and what redreſſe was there to be had? and then, had we <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The other is <hi>Civill</hi> or Politique. The benefits of Lawes, freedome from illegall burdens upon perſons and goods, liberty to oppoſe ſuch impoſitions legally. And I appeale to your ſelves, what was become of this freedome too? He that will be ignorant let him be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>

And I preſſe the more to the conſideration of this point, becauſe it is a common and Cannel-argument or ſhift of the delinquent party, that there are but ſome members diſeaſed in our Church (as they call it) and therefore they conceive it too ſevere and riged a cure to alter the whole. <label type="milestone">

And now to ſpeake home to the maine bulk of the Objection, 'Tis pretended that there were but few perſons in our Church that were amiſſe,

For anſwer, I ſay, let us looke upon the Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of that Oath, and thoſe Canons, doe they not all run ſtill in a plurall number? yea in an univerſall? is it not <hi>We,</hi> and <hi>

               <p n="1">1. Firſt,
<note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> the <hi>Locuſts</hi> are ſaid to be like unto <hi>Horſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto battell:</hi> ſo the Jeſuites they are the Popes, yea Satans cavellery.</p>

               <p>The Multitudes of theſe worſt of Papiſts have bin very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62468:21"/>great amongſt us of late, yea 'twas conceived by ſome of judgement and conſcience, that in our Metropolis there were more of theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> (I meane of Jeſuites) at one time, then there were Proteſtant Miniſters of all ſorts in that City.

               </p>
               <p>And Brethren, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to match this, what think yee of the groſſe ſuppreſſing of light in this Kingdome of late, and the many meanes that have bin uſed both to drive, and to keep cut knowledge? Let me ſhew you but ſome ſteps and degrees of this <hi>darknes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, our weekly <hi>Lectures,</hi> and all meere <hi>Lecturers</hi> were ſuppreſſing or ſuppreſſed already, in ſome Dioces they were wholy put down; in others, partly, beſides that the ſetting up of more was either denied or ſupplanted. Yea in thoſe places where the enemies of light had not the face or power utterly to ſuppreſſe <hi>Lectures,</hi> yet there they would quarter them, yea doubly and triply quarter them, foure, eight, twelve men in ſome Townes were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one weekly exerciſe, that ſo it might become like that web of <hi>Penelope,</hi> that one man might untwiſt that the other did ſpin; or at leaſt that the multitude of Cookes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62468:21"/>might marte the potrage. No, no, this ſort of lights was too bright and blazing for thoſe enemies to ſuffer them, they were as wandring Planets or Comets rather, and did as they thought caſt a dangerous influence upon their Tribe, and therefore they muſt be extinguiſhed. Hence the very name of <hi>Lecturer</hi> was become (to ſome Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) both ridiculous and odious. Yea, as theſe many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners (againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>) from <hi>Ireland</hi> doe complain in that Kingdome, the Prieſts and Fryers were both gueſts and neighbours to ſome of their grand Church-men, when a poore Lecturer could not be ſuffered to live, nay, durſt ſcarce be ſeen amongſt them. Yea further, it was grown a maxime amongſt your great Clearks (great in Benefices I meane) that a Lecturer had no footing in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this maxime perhaps ſhortly ſhould have bin made a Canon too; but a ſtrange poſition (me thinks) it is, that one which hath bin called to the Miniſtry, ordained by themſelves, and is commanded by the Lord, yea by his Ordinary, <hi>to preach the Gospell,</hi> which he doth (ſuppoſe) ably, faithfully and fruitfully, that yet this man ſhould have no footing in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> This makes me to wonder farther what a Church of <hi>England</hi> theſe Rabbies would make; ſuch a Church (it ſeems) it muſt be as doth exclude and diſmember thoſe Miniſters which are too very Preachers. In a word, you know Brethren (if you know any thing) how this ſect of men (as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them) were every where ſpoken againſt as the troublers of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> How many of them are driven away into the wilderneſſe of <hi>America?</hi> Others were ſo faſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned that they could not obtaine the liberty of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and other-ſome ſilenced, ſuſpended, deprived by companies. And leaſt after thoſe undoing cenſures they ſhould ſhelter themſelves and maintaine their poore fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by ſome other liberall faculty, they were way layd by theſe Canons which did enjoyne to the very School-maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the ſame ſubſcription as to Miniſters. Let me conclude touching this ſort of men and their former condition eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62468:22"/>
                  <hi>We are made (by them) as the filth of the world, and as the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.13.</note> Thus this ſort of light was ecclipſed. But thoſe were accounted wandring Planets (as I ſaid) and ſuch as had no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us looke next upon beneficed Miniſters, theſe are acknowledged (by the great <hi>Extinguiſhers) to be fixed Stars,</hi> and to have footing in their <hi>Church of England,</hi> and yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe (eſpecially if painfull and conſcientious) could not have footing in their owne Pulpits upon the weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, nor in the after-noone of the Sabbath. Nay, they were in ſome whole Counties forbidden then to catechize, ſave onely in the bare words of that <hi>Childiſh Catechiſme;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> they durſt not goe an inch out of their truckle. Here I might adde the many cunning inventions and cruell preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of multitudes of Innovations, eſpecially in matter of worſhip, <hi>Tables</hi> were <hi>Altared, Crucifixes erected, bowings introduced,</hi> and many other ſcandalous, ridiculous and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome actions and geſtures impoſed, and all theſe were uſed, but as ſo many fanns or rinſives, ot boult out the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, Orthodox and active Clergy, that they might be blowne off as chaffe in every Dioces. Thus both our Planets and fixed Starrs were darkned.</p>
               <p>But now was there no other kind or means of light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe two which the people might procure to guide their feet into the wayes of grace and peace? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Yes, there was another, a third kind or means, it was the <hi>Candle-light</hi> of <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>holy Bookes,</hi> theſe might have ſupplied in ſome meaſure the want of both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And therfore the <hi>grand Extinguiſhers,</hi> were well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough aware of this alſo, and do take a compleat courſe for prevention. The ſprings and fountains of godly Treatiſes they knew to be of two ſorts, ſome were penned within the Kingdome, and to meet with theſe, an Order is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from <hi>Starr-chamber,</hi> that they muſt all come through the hands of their Creatures. Other (ſuch) books might be brought in from other countries, and therefore in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62468:22"/>ſame order it is provided, that all forraigne books likewiſe muſt paſſe under the ſelfe ſame <hi>Cenſors,</hi> and all this, leaſt thoſe poore conſcientious ſouls (which they call <hi>Mechanicall</hi> and <hi>Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgars</hi>) ſhould get ſo much as <hi>lamp-light</hi> to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to diſcover their miſ-leaders. Thus had theſe men like thoſe <hi>Gileadites</hi> at <hi>Jordan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jud 12.5. ver. 16.</note> taken all the chiefe paſſages of knowledge, ſo that whatſoever man or paper, book or Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had not pronounced their <hi>Shibboleth</hi> aright, he ſhould have bin cruſhed, or ſuppreſſed in the birth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea higher yet, becauſe ſome <hi>Puritanicall</hi> Miniſters (I ſpeake in their Dialect) had an art of preaching and peſtring in their very prayers, before and after Sermon; therefore a courſe is taken, that they muſt confine themſelves in the Pulpit before Sermon, to a certaine <hi>Canonicall Sceleton,</hi> that is layd downe in one of their illegall Canons, in which (me thinkes) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth profer and promiſe the people fairly concerning prayer, but is hardly ſo good as his word to the end, and after Sermon they concluded with certain Collects at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay once more, to ſhew you the Superlative depth and blacknes of this darknes, ſome have bin forbidden and checkt (if not puniſhed) for uſing of conceived prayer in their Families, and becauſe they did not there bind themſelvs to the Common prayer book only. Judge ye Brethren, whether we were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to be ſhut up under darknes as bad as <hi>Aegyptian.</hi> Did I ſay as bad? nay ours was worſe in a double reſpect,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>Aegypts darknes</hi> was <hi>Corporall</hi> and <hi>Outward,</hi> but <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> was <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Mentall,</hi> which is an immediate and certain fore-runner of <hi>darknes eternall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 27.11.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a people of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, therfore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no pitty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aegypts</hi> was not <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall, for all the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>had light in their dwellings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> So we had ſome <hi>Goſhen</hi> too among us (may ſome ſay) in the worſt of thoſe times, ſome Dioces,
<note place="margin">Ex 10.23.</note> ſome Church-men were not ſo bad as the reſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Brethren, there is a kind of method even in the ſetting of the Sun, it is dark at <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and there awayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62468:23"/>it is night at <hi>Sarum, Exon</hi> and <hi>Launceſton;</hi> becauſe thoſe former Counties are more Eſterly; but the ſame blacke cloud was comming apace over all the reſt, though they were not wholy and actually over-whelmed. The month, nay the very day was ſet, for a generall Ecclipſe, yea for an extirpation of all thoſe lights in the Land which ſhould have ſtucke at that horrid Oath. <hi>November</hi> the ſecond, laſt yeare, one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty, then, then was the time when the great <hi>Curefue-bell</hi> ſhould have bin rung out for covering of fires, and putting out of Candles, in every County, City, Towne and Pariſh throughout the Kingdome. Thus was our plague of <hi>Darknes,</hi> the worſt indeed of all the nine.</p>
               <p>And yet the Removall or Remedy of this alſo, do our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; for there is an Order now come from the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, both for ſetting up of <hi>Weekly Lectures</hi> by the Pariſhoners, and for after-noon preaching where there is none; ſo that, if we will, light may now ſhine out of darknes, and that ſo brightly, that the darknes may not be able to comprehend it.</p>
               <p>The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt was, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that <hi>Death of their First-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it came to paſſe that at mid-night the Lordſmote all the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in the Land of</hi> Aegypt,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.29.</note> 
                  <hi>from the Firſt-borne of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>that ſate on his throne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>unto the firſt-borne of the Captive that was in the Dungeon, and all the firſt-borne of Cattell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I muſt Paralell with our late troubles in the <hi>North,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with that warre againſt our <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> True, there is a difference in this, that in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there was not an houſe in which there was not one dead by that plague; in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> not many have dyed by this warre. But for that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, bleſſed be the over-ruling hand of our good God, no thanke to thoſe Incendiaries, for could they have obtained their purpoſe, 'tis more then probable, that the death of one of every houſe (in this Iſland) would not have ſerved the turn, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there would ſcarcely have bin one of an houſe left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in many Families of the two Kingdoms. Therefore thats no great difference. But the Paralell doth hold in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Exod. 12. v. 29.</note> Firſt, that <hi>Aegypts</hi> plague was at <hi>midnight;</hi> ſo this warr was ſo contrived, as to come upon us in the depth of our palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62468:23"/>
                  <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkneſſe, of which before. Firſt, the eye of knowledge ſhould have bin put out amongſt us, and then <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like, we had bin fit to grind in their Mill, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as he) to have pulled downe the houſe upon our owne heads.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that plague was the laſt of the tenne, yea, it was an immediate cauſe and fore-runner of <hi>Iſraels</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and <hi>Deliverance</hi> from their intollerable taske maſters. <hi>He ſmote alſo all the firſt-borne in the land;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 105.36, 37.</note> 
                  <hi>the chiefe of all their ſtrength.</hi> And then immediately, <hi>he brought them forth with ſilver and gold, and there was not one feeble perſon among their tribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. So, it is our hope Bretheren (for <hi>Removall</hi>) that the good God will make that Northerne warre, the concluſion of all theſe our plagues, yea and an occaſion or cauſe of our greater ſtrengthning and enrichment.
<note place="margin">Judg. 14.14.</note> We ſee that <hi>there is ſome meate come out of the eater, and out of the ſtrong there is come ſome ſweetneſſe</hi> already. Perfect thou ô Lord the thing which thou haſt begunne amongſt us. So much touching <hi>Removall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third branch of <hi>Deliverance</hi> (which we gather by looking upon our evills felt or feared) it was called <hi>Prevention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a great mercy to a ſick man to have the paine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of his diſeaſe ſtopped, it is a greater, to have his malady quite Removed, but for a perſon to be kept and preſerved ſafe from all touch of a diſeaſe that was neere him, to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a <hi>Prevention</hi> of the plague that was next doore, this is a mercy above many. And therefore this third branch is both higher and greater then both the former; and yet it is leſſe valued generally then either of thoſe. For thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues which are Stopped or Removed from a Nation, they were preſent and actuall: but that miſchiefe which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and kept off, is at moſt (in reſpect of our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) but a poſſible and future evill, and therefore we are leſſe ſenſible of this (though greater) evill. In ſhort, that bitterneſſe which we have felt, we know by ſence to be bitter, whereas much more, being eſcaped by us, becauſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62468:24"/>eſcaped may ſeeme leſſe. Hence it is that the Lord doth looſe much prayſe and glory for this ſort of mercy. <hi>Nabal</hi> (we know) did returne but little thanks, and leſſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to <hi>David</hi> for the ſafe guarding of his <hi>Shepheards in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.10.</note> the reaſon was, becauſe the good done to him by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> was a <hi>Prevention,</hi> he did preſerve the men, and flocks from danger, ſo that the chutle felt no evill, and therefore did value the curtiſie as nothing: So is it twixt us and God, we give him little prayſe for great mercy, if it be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us in a <hi>Prevention,</hi> whereas ſhould the Lord have ſuffered thoſe evills (now prevented) to have come upon us in part, and then had taken them off againe, we ſhould have given him greater prayſe for a leſſer favour.</p>
               <p>But here you may aske me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> what means can we uſe, or what may we doe to ſee and value this branch of mercy which you call <hi>Prevention,</hi> becauſe miſchiefes kept off did never come within kenne?</p>
               <p>Though thoſe evills which have bin prevented never came in kenne of dull and ſhort-ſighted eyes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> yet (let me tell you, that) every holy, wiſe and gratefull <hi>Seer,</hi> might and did perceive them to be many and grievous. And that I may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thoſe ſhorter ſights, give me leave to lend them ſome few perſpective or ſpectacle glaſſes, to quicken and ſtrengthen their apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then ſee what a black Northerne cloud of warre and ruine did hang over our heads of late, though it pleaſed the God of peace to blow it beyond us, ſo that it did not breake and fall upon this <hi>Iſland.</hi> What head can gueſſe, what heart can bewaile ſufficiently, the probable end and iſſue of thoſe inteſtine commotions? utter deſtruction of one Kingdome (who knowes which?) was the beſt iſſue that could in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood be hoped. But of this I have ſpoken before.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Prevention</hi> is of <hi>Treaſons,</hi> more then one, yea ſince the ſitting of this Parliament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One in <hi>England;</hi> who can be ignorant thereof? a plot it ſeemes it was both againſt that higheſt Councell, and the whole Kingdome, the leſſe we doe know of it, the greater (in my judgement) and the deeper ſhould it be thought.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62468:24"/>Sure I am, of theſe two things in print, Firſt, that ſome of the plotters are fled, and purſued by Proclamation, a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Hue and Cry is gone after them. Secondly, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, to that thrice worthy Proteſtation doth declare how ſome endeavours had bin uſed to bring the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army into a miſconſtruction of the preſent Parliament. The <hi>Prevention</hi> of this <hi>Treaſon,</hi> becauſe as yet ſome what unknown to us, may deſerve the more of our prayſes and prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And another in <hi>Scotland</hi> too, as doth appeare by their proceedings in that Kingdome.</p>

                  </label> there are ſome certaine ſorts of perſons which will not, which muſt not take an anſwer, and be convinced of this poynt, that the innovating guilty faction would have brought in <hi>Popery.</hi> As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all your <hi>Delinquents,</hi> that have had a finger in the pye, your guilty perſons that are the foremoſt parties in the caſe, theſe muſt not beleeve this, nor be convinced.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all their <hi>Dependents</hi> too, that doe any way hang upon the guilty faction, or have neere relations unto them. You muſt alſo give theſe men leave to be hard of beliefe in this point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> (yea) and all others which in their Sermons and diſcourſes, by their pennes, purſes, or otherwiſe, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> (perhaps) or for the late innovations, and illegall impoſitions. All theſe, and all the reſt of the like kinde, muſt not ſee Reaſon or ground, why any one ſhould thinke that they could or would have brought in <hi>Popery.</hi> But for others, which are innocent, free, and ingenious, if they make this queſtion, now I anſwer them.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let me ſpeake to that part of the Objection, that they <hi>could</hi> not have brought in <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. True it is, if we looke upon our <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> we have a <hi>gratious, orthodox, fixed, proteſtant Majeſty.</hi> As appeareth, not only by his conſtant firmeneſſe, when he was in <hi>Spaine</hi> (the <hi>Shop of Popery</hi>) but by his <hi>Royall promiſes, Vow, Oath</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> ever ſince he ſwayed the <hi>Scepter.</hi> And in this reſpect, we muſt preſume and conclude that they <hi>could</hi> never have brought it in.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

And when I call to mind the ſtrange prevalency and power of ſome, in paſſing the late <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> to the prejudice of the King and Kingdome, then I am farre from the peremptorineſſe of thoſe which doe ſo boldly affirme that they could never have brought in <hi>Popery.</hi> So much for the <hi>[could not.]</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62468:25"/>2. But for that other part of the Objection, touching the will and intention of that party, that they <hi>would</hi> not have done it; (pardon) I cannot be ſo <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,</hi> as not to think that they would have brought it in.</p>
               <p>Firſt, not ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable;</hi> namely, to thoſe many <hi>Orthodox, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> able, holy judgements,</hi> which are cleare and ſtrong of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. True, twas thought by ſome godly and judicious ones at firſt, that <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> was the only aime and end of the Innovatours, but they did ſoone out-ſhoot this marke, and ſo ſhewed that that hereſie was but their ſtalking-horſe. Next, it was gueſſed they did drive at <hi>Lutheraniſme,</hi> but at laſt it was both ſeen and felt, that nothing leſſe then flat <hi>Popery</hi> (perhaps <hi>French Popery</hi> indeed) could terminate their deſires.

And indeed this alone (in my judgement) is true <hi>Charity,</hi> if a man be ſo charitable as that withall he may keepe the truth; for there is a kind of <hi>Crudelis miſcricordia,</hi> as the wiſe man ſaith in another ſence, <hi>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruell,</hi> that is, when men will be ſo charitable to perſons, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cruell to <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Thus I cannot be ſo <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nor can I be ſo <hi>Blind,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as to thinke that <hi>Popery</hi> was not their maine deſigne and deſire. Brethren, will ye, ſhall we believe our owne eyes and eares in the buſineſſe? then conſider what things we have (or might have) ſeen this way to confirme us? What <hi>Popiſh Diſcourſes, Pamphlets, Sermons</hi> and <hi>Practiſes</hi> have paſſed <hi>the Preſſe</hi> and <hi>Pulpit with licence.</hi> In ſhort, conſider with your ſelves, but theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Doctrine, what <hi>Innovations</hi> directly contrary to the <hi>Ancient, Venerable Proteſtant Truthes?</hi> Take a ſip or two. Firſt, the Pope wont to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but now our new Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Printers, will tell us that 'tis no ſuch matter. No, now if we will have an Anti-chriſt we muſt goe ſeek him amongſt <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> Againe, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was wont amongſt Proteſtants to be accounted the <hi>Scarlet-Whore</hi> and <hi>mysticall Babylon;</hi> but now marriage hath made her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſhe is become in a ſence a true Church. What ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62468:26"/>I ſpeake of publiſhed <hi>Popery</hi> in points of <hi>Juſtification, Free-will, Merit, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> yea by ſome Innovatours, both the name and parts of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> are received.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> what groſſneſſe of late about <hi>Altars, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in a ſence? what <hi>Images, Pictures, Duckings, Baſins, Candle-ſticks</hi> and the like? Brethren, what ſhall I ſay? I ſhould tire your patience, my ſelfe, the time, to follow theſe wilely and wicked chaſed Foxes; but my comfort is, that I doe ſpeake to them which are Chriſtians, Proteſtants, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable living Creatures, which have eyes and ears of their own, to reade and heare, and theſe may informe you ſufficiently of this truth. But for brevities ſake, if any deſire to ſee more, I ſhall direct him to theſe two helps for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, the ſeverall <hi>Petitions, Charges, Accuſations, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> put into the <hi>Parliament</hi> againſt the ſeverall Innovators.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And next, the <hi>Cenſures of them,</hi> for the ſame, as they have bin and ſhall be found guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſuppoſe ſome few of the Innovators did drive at flat <hi>Popery,</hi> yet we cannot but thinke that many others of them had not ſo groſſe an ayme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There was no good truſting of them, <hi>He that will lye will ſteale</hi> (we ſay) <hi>and he that will ſteale a pinne, will much more steale a pound.</hi> Suppoſe ſome of the hindmoſt hunters did not ſo clearly ſee the game; ſuppoſe ſome of the lower and leſſer wheeles of the frame, did not aime at the flat, full and groſſe lumpe of <hi>Popery,</hi> perhaps that was too big for ſome of their conſciences to ſwallow it whole at firſt: but ſuppoſe that the lump had bin divided into bits, morſels and pils, which ſhould have bin ſized to their ſeverall throats, then I doubt much whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would have ſtuck to take it downe. Nay, we know that they had generally let down many morſels already, and 'tis harder to reſiſt the degrees, then it was to with-ſtand the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Therfore I cannot be ſo <hi>Blind,</hi> as to think they <hi>Would</hi> not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally, neither can I be ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndutifull</hi> as to thinke it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull</hi> to that <hi>High and Honourable Aſſembly.</hi> Doth not this <hi>Bleſſed Parliament</hi> know as well as we, what was the ayme of that <hi>Innovating faction?</hi> and they tell us in their <hi>Preamble</hi> to

Theſe and the like <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of theirs, I cannot but in duty believe and ſubſcribe unto them, as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments convincing us of the truth of this point in hand: ſo that I ſhall now conclude this whole Diſcourſe with thoſe words of the Apoſtle—<hi>If any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi>

               <p>The following <hi>Branches</hi> of our <hi>Deliverance</hi> did ariſe from the <hi>Conſideration</hi> of that Good which we now have and hope for. And ſo</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The fourth Head of this mercifull Deliverance is CONTINUANCE.</head>
               <p>I meane, an intire Continuance of all that good which we did enjoy, but were upon the very nick of looſing it. We ſay in our common Proverbe, <hi>That a penny well ſaved is ſo much got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and is it not ſo in mercies? A mercy continued is as much as if it were new given us.

               <p>Now Brethren, how many mercies have we yet ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unto us which we did give over for a few months ſince for loſt and deſperate? as to give an inſtance or two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, concerning our painfull and conſcientious Miniſters. How much mony (think we) might have bin collected in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> throughout all Congregations about a yeare and quarter ſince, to have bought the certain Continuance of all godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours amongſt their people but till now? doubtleſſe there would much more have bin given then hath bin paid for Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Pole-mony, ſince the beginning of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and yet how whinching were many in thoſe payments? And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62468:27"/>how few do conſider this to be ſo great a favour? O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and go home muſing upon this gracious <hi>Continuance.</hi> Think with your ſelves, and ſay to your friends and children. O what invaluable goodneſſe is this, that the voyce of the Turtle (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſhreeking of <hi>Zim Ohim</hi>) is yet heard in our Land? the <hi>Bels</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> (and not the Hawksbels) doe ſtill ring in our cares? Bleſſing and praiſe be to the Lord who alone doth wondrous things.
<note place="margin">Pſ. 136. v. 4.</note> Brethren, I would have you that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to look upon all your conſcientious Miniſters (thoſe which you think, nor could, nor would have taken that oath) as upon men raiſed up from the dead and come out of their graves again; and therfore me thinks you ſhould hearken to them with freſh and double attention. You know what <hi>Dives</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Parable,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Nay, father</hi> Abraham: <hi>but if one went unto my Brethren from the dead, they will repent.</hi> Let us not be worſe then <hi>Dives</hi> his Brethren: but let us look upon and hearken to all ſuch Miniſters as Meſſengers twiſe given us, ſent from the dead, and as preaching rather out of <hi>Coffins</hi> then <hi>Pulpits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here is a main cauſe of our generall inſenſiblenes of this mercy, becauſe our <hi>Shepheards</hi> were not utterly, actually and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally removed and gon from us, therfore we can ſcarce believe and conceive that they were certainly going?</p>
               <p>But to remove that deceit of heart, conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, that ſome were utterly and actually already gone and driven out; and this both <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> can too truly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Looke <hi>Eaſtward</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> and how many of our choyce and extraordinary Teachers were driven thither, and durſt not ſhew their heads here (untill this Parliament) for fear of Priſons and Purſevants? and all for ſcrupling at a few Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, confeſſed by the Innovators themſelves to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? Look but upon the books of thoſe Miniſters, which they have ſent over ſince their baniſhment: Looke upon their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and ſervices done for us, beſides the damnage to cloathing occaſioned by their departure, and then you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that many of our choiſe Miniſters, were driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way actually into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to our great damnage. But the <hi>Weſt</hi> can tell us of a farre greater number, now wandring in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62468:27"/>of <hi>America.</hi> One man of God is a precious Jewell in a Kingdome, and may doe much for the publick ſafety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a whole Land in time of need, as we ſee in <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 2.12.</note> what a loſſe is it then to one poore Iſland to have ſcores of ſuch <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horſe-men,</hi> driven away at a clap?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others, if not quite gone, yet were going apace. How many honeſt <hi>Kenites</hi> were packing up their <hi>Fardels?</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and as of Miniſters, ſo for the continuance of all other Spirituall, and Nationall good things which (I ſay again) ſtood a tiptoe, and were (as it were) upon the wing, they are all new given unto us.

I anſwer as he—<hi>Oceani fluctus me numerare jubes</hi>—In Scripture phraſe; <hi>they are more then J am able to expreſſe, I muſt give them in by heaps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We heard before of a Paralell to all the <hi>ten plagues of Aegypt;</hi> but what if I ſhould now ſhew a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of great works of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> out-ſtripping, yea doubling that number? I will not over-lay your attentions before hand with a promiſe of prolixity, but let us obſerve ſome famous particulars done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and thoſe for the <hi>Glory of our God,</hi> the perpetuall <hi>Honor</hi> of our dread <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> and the laſting <hi>praiſe</hi> of this <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62468:28"/>
               <p>1. The firſt <hi>obſervable Addition</hi> muſt be <hi>that Act for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Treaty of</hi> Pacification.</p>
               <p>I cannot but ſet it in the fore-front of my catalogue, as the firſt lincke in this golden chaine, and the baſis of all the reſt of our late mercies. The whole <hi>Act</hi> is true, 'tis large, but to me ſo much the ſweeter; let him that can (for me) reade it over with dry eyes, (I meane, for joy: for) I thinke that <hi>Act</hi> is looked upon by diverſe ſorts of men, as was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſecond <hi>Temple</hi> among the <hi>Jewes.</hi> 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Many wept with a loud voyce, and many ſhouted aloud for joy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezr. 3.11, 12.</note> So, doubtleſſe, all that wiſh well to our <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to Church and State, they cannot but rejoyce in reading thereof: but as many as are contrary-minded, (like enough) doe repine and howle in ſecret, to ſee ſo bleſſed a cloſe of ſo perilous a buſineſſe. Brethren, let me commend the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reading or hearing of that <hi>Act,</hi> to every judicious and fit Proteſtant and Subject now preſent, and alſo (if they pleaſe) to all thoſe which have bin ſo loud, fierce and active heretofore, againſt our Bretheren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Oh let theſe latter reade, bluſh, repent, and change their minds, with ſhame and ſorrow: but the former, let them be confirmed and lifted up in their holy, loyall intentions and proceedings.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the whole <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Statute,</hi> may be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there are (I doe not trifle away holy time about ſecular things) the <hi>Commiſſions</hi> upon which that treaty at <hi>Rippon</hi> was grounded. As oft as I reade them over, and doe looke upon the names of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of both ſides; ſo often (me thinks) there commeth into my minde, the <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> and <hi>tranſactors</hi> of that <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.10, 11, 12 &amp;c.</note> and thoſe other two tribes and halfe, beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> it was concerning an <hi>Altar of Teſtimony</hi> which theſe latter had builded. Great danger there was at firſt of a bloudy, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious-civill warre,</hi> but afterwards, by the prudence of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> on both ſides, they rightly underſtanding each others meaning, all is concluded in a firmer peace then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>bone</hi> is ſtronger after ſetting, then it was before the <hi>diſlocation;</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi> is called <hi>[Ed.]</hi> a <hi>witneſſe:</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62468:29"/>Some thinks we may write the word [<hi>Ed.</hi> a <hi>witneſſe</hi>] upon every <hi>enſigne, gunne, ſpeare</hi> and <hi>ſword,</hi> that hath bin lifted up on either ſide, in thoſe late <hi>Northerne expeditions;</hi> and each weapon may be kept as a <hi>teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> mercy, our <hi>Soveraigns</hi> goodneſſe, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> wiſdome, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> noble ſervice on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelfe, all the <hi>Demands, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Articles,</hi> with their ſeverall <hi>Grants, Anſwers</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 25. v. 11.</note> like <hi>apples of gold, in ſtudds of ſilver;</hi> and all this is cloſed and crowned,
<note place="margin">Pſal 46. v. 8.</note> with a day of publique <hi>thankeſgiving.</hi> Let us adde thoſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the earth.</hi> In other Kingdomes deſolations:

                  <hi>he burneth the Chariot in the fire. The Lord of hoſts is with us, the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our refuge,</hi> Selah.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> a dramme of <hi>Lethe,</hi> to cloſe up all, that ſo all Acts and Monuments of hoſtility, may be buried in everlaſting forgetfullneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Addition</hi> or meſſe of <hi>Deliverance</hi> (already ſerved in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us) is that <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> laſt <hi>September,</hi> containing theſe foure heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>removing</hi> the <hi>Communion table,</hi> taking away the <hi>Railes, levelling</hi> of <hi>Chancells,</hi> &amp;c. 2. For aboliſhing of <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> Scandalous pictures of Perſons of the <hi>Trinity, Images</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> taking away of <hi>Tapers, Candleſtickes, Baſons,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Againſt <hi>Corporall bowing,</hi> both at the name <hi>(Jeſus)</hi> and towards the <hi>East.</hi> 4. For <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. I am forced by the generall neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this <hi>Declaration</hi> to make it my next <hi>Addition,</hi> though it be in time one of the laſt. I have but two things breefely to ſhew in this poynt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods great goodneſſe to us, in granting ſuch <hi>an Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our vile and baſe <hi>unthankfulneſſe</hi> ſhewed to him, in the entertainement thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this <hi>Declaration</hi> was a great mercy: for ſome of the things there to be removed, were a part of our late Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, they have bin ſome of the <hi>rocks</hi> and <hi>ſands,</hi> which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62468:29"/>have wracked multitudes of our conſcientious and powerfull Miniſters. In ſhort, are they not (at leaſt ſome of them) maine grounds of Papiſts hopes, and other Proteſtants deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires, touching communion with us? and yet lo, now (by this <hi>Declaration</hi>) a price is put into our hands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this <hi>rocke,</hi> and to take away theſe <hi>ſands,</hi> to cauſe other reformed Churches to hope, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> to deſpaire, of our returne towards them, and is not this a precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? a wonderfull favour? eſpecially if we conſider how ſtrongly thoſe ſuperfluities of our Religion were back'd of late. Why, they were the riſing Ceremonies, the very roade to preferment from ſome; he that could but fill his hands, yea his Church, with theſe, was by them made a Prieſt of the High places: and now to have ſuch things aboliſhed and downed by <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>Parliament,</hi> yea, to have but free permiſſion from all the Commonalty of the Kingdome to doe it, I ſay, 'tis a thing which for a while ſince was incredible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now how is this golden opportunity improved? Brethren, it doth even ſicken my body, and ſadden my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to obſerve how dully, nay how contemptuouſly this mercy of God, and goodneſſe of that Honourable Houſe is entertained amongſt us, amongſt us I ſay againe. Some god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward Pariſhes indeed there are in this place; but I ſpeake onely of the guilty. Hath the Lord placed this City in the midſt of our <hi>County,</hi> as a <hi>Beacon</hi> upon an hill, yea, as the <hi>Center, heart</hi> and <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſhall this <hi>beacon</hi> not blaze by it's example, in every part, when there is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, loyall, refining fire put into it, by ſo great Authority? nay, ſhall this heart and head of the <hi>Weſt</hi> (in great part) convay nothing but dullneſſe and drowſineſſe to that whole body? In a word, are we the Redeemed people, the Mayden City, <hi>faithfull for ever to our King,</hi> and doe many of us now thus requite the Lord that preſerved us? Are, or can they be thus <hi>unthankefull</hi> to the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> in this great truſt and ſervice? Oh let all whom this concernes immediately, and all others who may have any hand in it more remotely, let them all take home theſe words of a grieved Miniſter,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62468:30"/>with ſhame and ſorrow, yea let them goe home and ſinne no longer.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, you muſt firſt anſwer our doubts and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, before you preſſe thus vehemently upon our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and affections; and theſe our Objections are many.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>1</label> Is, touching the Authority of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> it came not (ſay they) from both Houſes, and therefore is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning Law?</p>
               <p>I anſwer ſeverally to both parts of the <hi>Obiection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Suppoſe that it came not from both Houſes, yet 1.

The Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> (which ſome doe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly or baſely nick-name the Lower-Houſe) they are our ſelves, we in them (in this ſence) and they in us: ſo that we may ſay touching this ſelf-neſſe, as the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> they are (as it were) neere of kinne to us, I meane, that as our Votes were in their Elections: ſo 'tis fit that our Wills ſhould be bound up in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and Declarations. 3. And where is he that durſt to ſow a jealous or evill ſurmiſe of diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Houſes of Parliament, concerning their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions?</p>
               <p>To that other clauſe, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, And is it come to that now, that we doe need force and conſtraint to make us reforme things amiſſe? I had thought for a yeere agoe, that bare <hi>permiſſion</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> to remove ſuch things as theſe, would have beene a ſufficient inducement unto us all. Little, little, did I then dreame that <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> would have needed compulſion to ſuch a reforming worke as this. 2. But however, know this, ye that ſlight this <hi>Declaration,</hi> as an Arrow without an head, know (I ſay) that ye are like to feele a penalty for your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. You which are reſolved (it ſeemes) to try the power and authority of that Honourable <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and will needs

But (my Brethren) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly theſe mens Conſciences are true taper-wax (as we ſay) that is, if they are ſmall and ſtraight at this end, then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they are very broad at the other end.</p>
               <p>But to deſcend to particulars. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> Where is it I pray you that your Conſciences doe ſtick ſo tenderly? what,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it at removing the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> taking away the <hi>Railes,</hi> and Levelling the <hi>Chancells,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe things are but Innovations and Superſtitious attendants of tran- and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, of which I could ſhew you the whole pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree: but this in ſhort, and to our purpoſe. Firſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoth, the <hi>Chancells</hi> muſt be ſeparated from the body of the Church, and ſo be made a <hi>More holy place,</hi> for the ſeating and burialls of more <hi>ſacred perſons,</hi> for the <hi>Clergy</hi> only. Next, the <hi>Table</hi> was brought up to them, as belonging moſt properly to the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Then, let them alone for <hi>Mounting, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taring, Railing, Crucifixes, Bowing,</hi> and at laſt there is made up a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to ſort with the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Altar.</hi> And doe your conſciences ſcruple to remove theſe things?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or is it at taking away of <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> ſcandalous <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> &amp;c. Of <hi>Tapers, Candleſticks, Baſons,</hi> that you ſtick?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62468:31"/>Theſe are attendants and promoters of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> they are againſt the Second Commandement, and are aboliſhed in other reformed Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or cannot you find in your Conſciences to forbeare <hi>bowing,</hi> what, towards the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> I anſwer, that is <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, and it is too well like unto that which is called the <hi>greater abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by God to <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 8.15, 16</note> Or what elſe? is it corporall <hi>bowing</hi> at the name <hi>[Jeſus?]</hi> Yes, here is the Scruple. And why? becauſe forſooth the Scripture commands it <hi>that at the name of (Jeſus) every knee ſhould bow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil 2.10.</note> &amp;c. I anſwer the Text from the Text: for in that verſe (as they reade it) I find a <hi>Miſ-Engliſhing,</hi> a <hi>Miſ-ſencing,</hi> and an <hi>Abſurdity.</hi> 1. A <hi>Miſ-Engliſhing:</hi> for how comes the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in the Originall, to be tranſlated <hi>[at?]</hi> whereas it doth properly ſignifie <hi>[in]</hi> and is ſo rendred in other places. But you will ſay <hi>[in]</hi> and <hi>[at]</hi> are both one? Then 'tis both one to ſay in that place of <hi>Mathew Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. v. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied</hi> [at] <hi>thy name, and</hi> [at] <hi>thy name caſt out Divels,</hi> &amp;c. 2. There is a <hi>Miſ-Sencing</hi> of that word <hi>[name,]</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> for who knowes not that in Scripture by the <hi>names</hi> of God, or of any perſon of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is commonly meant their <hi>eſſence.</hi> Brethren, you can all ſay the Lords prayer, what is meant there by <hi>hallowing of Gods [name?]</hi> You can alſo ſay the Ten Commandements, what is meant in the third, by <hi>taking Gods [name] in vaine?</hi> But 3. There is alſo an <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> in their reading of that verſe of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> for what knees have Angels (good and evill?) how can Birds, Beaſts and Fiſhes, bow the knee corporally? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the wiſeſt of that tribe of Word-worſhippers, have given over this text as improper for their purpoſe, and doe fly to an ancient and laudible cuſtome to hold by? To which I anſwer, 1. <hi>Antiquity</hi> without <hi>verity</hi> is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate error. 2. And this being but a <hi>humane invention,</hi> how can it be true, and pure worſhip? That's enough to ſatisfy your Conſciences. And now the ſame ſtaffe is in my hand, yea, let me preſſe it upon your Conſciences (if they are ſo tender) and charge you to give over your unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62468:31"/>deviſed and partiall worſhip of God. I call it partiall, both becauſe it ſeemes to give more honour to the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then to the reſt, and in the ſecond Perſon it beſtowes more worſhip upon one name of his then upon another. Thus (as I conceive) all colourable Objections and Pretences are quite blowne off. But now, are theſe orders obeyed? is all this done? No, but this Order, though according to the expreſſe Word of God, though comming from ſo Honourable and Bleſſed a Court, though preſſed ſo earneſtly with Reaſons and Scripture by our faithfull Paſtours, yet this Order (I ſay ſtill) is neglected, in moſt Churches wholly, in others partially, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in deſpight of God, Governours and Miniſters. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in the windows, do ſtill out-face us in our Pulpits. The Railes or Tables, ſtand as they did, and the bowings are continued. Is this our requitall to the Lord for late Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Is this our forwardneſſe to <hi>Reformation</hi> ſo long deſired? What? hath God <hi>stopped</hi> ſo many bloody iſſues? hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved ſo many <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plagues? Hath he prevented ſo much <hi>Treaſon</hi> in both <hi>Kingdomes?</hi> and is this our <hi>fruit,</hi> our <hi>Requitall</hi> for all theſe wonders? Cannot we yet finde in our hearts to pull down a <hi>ſcandalous Puppet,</hi> to breake an <hi>Idoll,</hi> or to give over a ſuperſtition for his ſake, yea, and that even then when we have Authority on our ſide? O ſtubborne, ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, uncapable Nation, a people I had almoſt ſaid <hi>incurable!</hi> Sure I am that many amongſt us doe hate to be <hi>reformed.</hi> What can I ſay more, but only to ſly and cry to the Lord for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and aſſiſtance? <hi>O thou the juſt and jealous God that viſiteſt the iniquities of Idolatrous Parents upon their children to the third and fourth generations, pardon this great ſinne unto us, and our poſterity, and lay it not to our charge in the day when thou ſhalt viſit our ſinnes upon us, neither let it hinder good things from us,</hi> &amp;c. Brethren, let me ſpeake freely, there is not any one thing that doth make me ſo much to feare what will be the iſſue of the preſent good worke of mercy, and to doubt leaſt this faire weather may be over-caſt againe with bloudy ſhowers, then doth this Epidemicall generall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, to take the <hi>opportunities</hi> and execute the <hi>Orders</hi> which are ſent downe for <hi>Reformation.</hi> Turn we ſadly to that

               <p>Firſt, his Ingagements to the worke it ſelfe, as an <hi>helper, Auxiliary</hi> or <hi>beginner,</hi> and theſe ought to ſupport our hopes not a little. It is an Argument with which I find the Saints in Scripture doe much ſtay their hopes, and preſſe the Lord in times of great provocation and perill. As when they had committed that great ſinne in making a <hi>Calfe,</hi> and the Lord had a kinde of deſire to conſume them;
<note place="margin">Exod. 32. v. 9. ver. 10, 11, 12</note> yet <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth this Argument to appeaſe wrath and to continue preſervation, and doth obtaine his requeſt.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62468:38"/>of a Reformation and Deliverance, are moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous in regard of the Enemies of thoſe workes, and that more wayes then one: for by this meanes, 1.

                  <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evill worke is not executed speedily</hi> (I may put in <hi>thorowly,) therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to doe evill;</hi> or at leaſt the enemies doe hereby grow more <hi>ſubtill</hi> and <hi>cautious</hi> (if not more <hi>impudent,</hi>) As a I ox that hath once broken the ſnare or ginne, it will coſt you double art, paynes, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to get him upon that advantage againe: So if once the <hi>Enemies</hi> can eſcape ſuch a ſcowring, they will worke more wiſely ever afterward, and tenne to one, if ere you take them ſo fairely upon the hyp in future times. 2. But chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch ſhort ſparring (as we ſay) doth make the Enemies more fierce, cruell and malicious, againſt all the Reforming party for ever afterward.

<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> when they purſued them to the red-Sea? Oh then, what triple tusks of bricks, with Scorpions inſtead of rodds, would they have layed upon them? To illuſtrate this poynt a little more cleerely: Suppoſe a hunter, or Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in ſhooting of a Stagg, or Wilde-Boare, doth not ſtrike it dead in the place, but onely wounds it: is not then the ſhooter himſelfe in as much danger as the game? is it not time for him preſently to fly for his owne life, for feare leaſt the bleeding beaſt doth fall upon him? Or once more, Suppoſe that a Prieſt or Levite of old, when he had

Like enough that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent have ſcarcely ever heard of ſuch an <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>Houſe,</hi> but an <hi>Order</hi> there is, and that viſible in print.

               </p>
               <p>Brethren, we have a generation which are deaf in this ear, and blind in this eye. Things that preſſe to ſtrictnes and exact walking are obſcure to them, though comming from a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Lord open our eys more and more, that we may ſee even by theſe things, who are the chief foſterers, yea, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62468:57"/>Garriſons of profaneneſſe in this Iſland. Yet ſuch an Order (I ſay) there is both cleare and viſible; but ſuppoſe it were but ſomewhat ordinary? Have we not a fourth Commandement for this duty onely, and is not that keene enough to ſharpen even an ordinary intimation from that High-Court? Let us therefore take, uſe and improove this <hi>Hanſell-mercy,</hi> this fore-taſte of <hi>Reformation</hi> to the uttermoſt. The Lord ſeems to proove by this ſhort and fore-running order, how well we will husband an opportunity of <hi>Reformation,</hi> how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full we will be in a little, that ſo he may take occaſion upon our diligence herein, to give us greater bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us take, uſe and improve lawfully all <hi>the Degrees of our lawfull Liberty,</hi> as they are beſtowed upon us by authority,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5. v. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us ſtand fast in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt</hi> (by the King and Parliament) <hi>doth make us more and more free, and be not</hi> (We) <hi>intangled againe with the yoke of bondage.</hi> There is a two-fold burden in this caſe, and conſequently a double Liberty to be lawfully taken and uſed.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62468:58"/>hath bin no barre, nor lock upon his leg, but he might (had he ſo much wit) ariſe and goe his way? Brethren, I would not have any reaſonable men thus unreaſonably dull and tame, but that when Law and authority ſhall bid them goe free, they ſhould take, uſe and enjoy that freedome. The obſervation of this leſſon is not only a fit expreſſion of our thankfulneſſe to the Lord, and to that authority that hath ſo freed us; but it is alſo a good means to put us into firm and actual poſſeſſion of our new lawfull liberty. If a mans conveyances for a purchaſe of land be never ſo good and ſubſtantiall, yet neglect of taking ſpeedy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion may endanger his good eſtate. Obſerve we therfore very diligently when any unlawfull fetters are ſtruck off from our necks and conſciences by Parliament, and let us ſpeedily (with <hi>Sampſon</hi>) ſhake our ſelves, and hold faſt that which we have received.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. True, we muſt not ſit in the Councell unleſſe we are choſen thereunto, but yet we may wait upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors with our ſubmiſſive <hi>Informations</hi> and <hi>Petitions.</hi> This themſelves do both allow and expect at our hands.</p>

               <p>Nay, my meaning is, that we muſt complain not only of thoſe <hi>Grievances</hi> in which our ſelves have felt a ſhare; but I do preſſe my ſelfe and you all, to ſeeke out, and gather up thoſe things which doe publikely offend, and to weed the common field. <hi>Brethren,</hi> this is a duty generally neglected, and therfore it is neceſſary, that all godly active ſpirits ſhould looke after it. When ſhall we ſee an husbandman grubb up bryers, or gather ſtones out of a field that lyes in Common to a whole Pariſh? No, but we ſay, every mans buſineſſe is no bodies buſineſſe: Extreamly needfull it is therfore that ſome choice Angelicall ſpirits, whoſe hearts the Lord hath touched, ſhould put to it, and become <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, by <hi>Atheists, Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Delinquents;</hi> but with good men or reaſonable, it muſt needs be acknowledged neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.

Beſides, in bodily cures, we know that a plain and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, being the patient in a diſeaſe, may give more light to the Phyſitian towards the cure by his relation, then all his learned books and long ſtudy may afford; for that Patient can tell him, how, when, and where the diſtemper did take and hold him: So is it in politike diſeaſes, a plain man that hath felt <hi>Greevances</hi> can better ſpeak of them then a greater perſon or Schollar, that kenns them but by reading or heare-ſay. 3. It is not the proper office of that Court to be Informers, becauſe they are Judges; and therefore my ſelfe have heard ſome of their members wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of many that ſuffer, 'tis expedient that other active men ſhould complaine in their behalves. For firſt; many places (as well as perſons) doe want skill and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to helpe themſelves, they cannot tell their owne tale (as we ſay) and therefore 'tis charity to them, as well as duty to the State, to be feete to the lame, and a mouth unto the dumbe. But by the way, I ſhould adviſe all ſuch to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſiſters ſonne,

You may ſee the cauſe by the effect, <hi>Then</hi> Zipporah <hi>tooke a ſharpe ſtone and cut off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of her ſonne,</hi> &amp;c.

<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He remooved her from being Queene, becauſe ſhe had made an Idoll in a Grove, and</hi> Aſa <hi>cut downe her Idoll, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brooke</hi> Kidron.
